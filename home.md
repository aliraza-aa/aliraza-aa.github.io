### Who We Are

We are a team of diverse, interdisciplinary scientists interested in studying, understanding, and drugging proteins with extreme conformational dynamics to address human disease. We are based in the [Department of Structural & Molecular Biology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/structural-and-molecular-biology) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). Read more about us [here](https://gthh2.github.io/who_we_are/).

### What We Do

30% of the human proteome is ‘undruggable’ because we lack data about how certain biomolecules, called intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), interact with drugs. IDPs are highly involved in many incurable diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, and diabetes, but we cannot use traditional methods alone (e.g. AlphaFold2, X-ray crystallography, nor cryo-electron microscopy) to study their structures nor druggabilities due to their highly dynamic nature. 


### How We Do It 

We use a combination of experimental techniques (e.g. nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, cryo-EM, biophysical methods) and computational approaches (e.g. molecular dynamics simulations) to study the role of IDPs in disease and understand how drugs interact with these dynamic biomolecules, with the ultimate goal of unleashing their enormous therapeutic potential.
