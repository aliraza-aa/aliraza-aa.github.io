### Who We Are 

We are a team of diverse, interdisciplinary scientists interested in studying, understanding, and drugging proteins with extreme conformational dynamics to address human disease. We are based in the [Department of Structural & Molecular Biology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/structural-and-molecular-biology) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). Read more about us [here](https://gthh2.github.io/who_we_are/).

### What We Do

30% of the human proteome is ‘undruggable’ because we lack data about how certain biomolecules, called intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), interact with drugs. IDPs are highly involved in many incurable diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, and diabetes, but we cannot use traditional methods alone (e.g. AlphaFold2, X-ray crystallography, nor cryo-electron microscopy) to study their structures nor druggabilities due to their highly dynamic nature.
