### New binding mechanisms 

Most drugs are small molecules that bind well-defined pockets within folded protein structures. Often, this binding is described as a ‘lock-and-key’ binding mechanism because the drugs (keys) fit snugly into protein sites (locks). However, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) rapidly interconvert between conformations and lack long-lived drug binding sites for small molecules. Consequently, these biomolecules are largely considered ‘undruggable’. We have recently discovered that that small molecules can indeed bind IDPs, but the mechanisms differ from traditional ‘lock-and-key’ binding and are instead highly dynamic. 


### New tools

The highly dynamic binding interactions between small molecules and IDPs are not amenable to standard drug discovery approaches. We develop and apply interdisciplinary methods spanning both experimental and computational biophysics to fill this technological gap.
