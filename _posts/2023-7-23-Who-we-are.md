We are a team of diverse, interdisciplinary scientists interested in studying, understanding, and drugging proteins with extreme conformational dynamics to address human disease. We are based in the [Department of Structural & Molecular Biology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/structural-and-molecular-biology) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk).
