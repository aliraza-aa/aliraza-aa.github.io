title: What we do
---

30% of the human proteome is ‘undruggable’ because we lack data about how certain biomolecules, called intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), interact with drugs. IDPs are highly involved in many incurable diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, and diabetes, but we cannot use traditional methods (AlphaFold2, X-ray crystallography, nor cryo-electron microscopy) to study their structures nor druggabilities due to their highly dynamic nature. We use a combination of experimental techniques (e.g. nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and computational approaches (e.g. molecular dynamics simulations) to study the role of IDPs in disease and understand how drugs interact with these dynamic biomolecules, with the ultimate goal of unleashing their enormous therapeutic potential.
